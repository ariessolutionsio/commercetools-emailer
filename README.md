# commercetools Emailer

## Overview

For digital commerce keeping customers informed is critical. This keeps customers happy and minimizes customer service requests. A key aspect of this communication is automated transactional emails, some examples include order confirmations, password resets, and shipping updates.

Aries created this commercetools emailer to tackle this requirement with an event-driven MACH approach. This application empowers users to create, edit, and manage email templates using a drag-and-drop editor. These templates are then used in the email event processor to send event-driven eCommerce emails.

### Key features

- Creating new email templates.
- Modifying templates with a user-friendly drag-and-drop editor.
- Managing templates for various transactional email types, such as order confirmations or password resets.

This projects allows businesses to manage their transactional emails directly without requiring code changes.
